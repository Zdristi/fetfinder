   - `MAIL_SERVER`: SMTP server (default: smtp.gmail.com)
   - `MAIL_PORT`: Port (default: 587)
   - `MAIL_USE_TLS`: Enable TLS (default: true)

## How to Use

2. Log in with your credentials
3. Complete your profile by adding:
   - Bio
   - Country and city (with dynamic dropdown selection)
   - Profile photo
   - Interests and fetishes
4. After completing your profile, you can:
   - View your profile
   - Browse all users
   - Start swiping to discover matches

## Swipe Interface

The swipe interface allows you to:
- Swipe left ( Reject) to pass on a profile
- Swipe right ( Like) to express interest
- Swipe up for a "Super Like"
- Or use the action buttons at the bottom

## Language Support

The site supports both English and Russian languages. You can switch languages using the globe icon in the top navigation bar.

## Dark/Light Theme

FetDate supports both dark and light themes:
- Toggle between themes using the moon/sun icon in the top navigation bar
- Your theme preference is saved in your browser
- Default theme is light

## Photo Upload

Users can upload profile photos in JPG, JPEG, PNG, or GIF formats. Photos are stored in the `static/uploads` directory.

## Location Features

Users can specify their country and city during profile completion:
- First select a country from the dropdown
- Then select a city from the dynamically loaded list

## Database

FetDate uses PostgreSQL database for persistent storage:
- User profiles and authentication
- User preferences (fetishes and interests)
- Match information
- Administrative data

The database is automatically created on first run.

## Moderation System

FetDate includes a comprehensive moderation system:

### Admin Panel
- Accessible only to admin users
- Manage all registered users
- Block/unblock users
- Delete user accounts
- Promote users to admin status

### User Blocking
- Blocked users cannot access the site
- Blocked users see a special page explaining why they were blocked
- Admins can specify a reason for blocking

### First User Admin
- The first user to register automatically becomes an admin
- Admins can promote other users to admin status

## Persistent Authentication

User sessions are maintained across browser restarts, so you don't need to log in every time.

## Database Setup on Render

To set up the database on Render:

1. Create a PostgreSQL database:
   - In Render Dashboard, click "New" â†’ "PostgreSQL"
   - Name it `fetfinder-db`
   - Select the same region as your web service
   - Choose "Free" plan
   - Click "Create Database"

2. Connect your web service to the database:
   - In your web service settings, add an environment variable:
     - Key: `DATABASE_URL`
     - Value: Copy the "External Database URL" from your PostgreSQL database

3. The database tables will be created automatically on first run.

## Docker Deployment

Detailed instructions for deploying the application using Docker on a Ubuntu virtual machine are available in [DEPLOY_INSTRUCTIONS.md](DEPLOY_INSTRUCTIONS.md).
